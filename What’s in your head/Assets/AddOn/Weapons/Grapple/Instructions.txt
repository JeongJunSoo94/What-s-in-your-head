Instructions & Notes


-Left Click on Any Gameobject to launch the hook (Hook will only stick if the gameobject has the tag "CanGrapple")

-(The Grappling Hook shoots at wherever the cursor is)

-Once Hooked on, press and hold the right mouse button to reel yourself in (This can be canceled at any time by simply releasing the right mouse button)

-Most values can be edited in the inspector, in the grapple script attached to the player

Notes:  

-The Grappling hook tends to shoot towards the top left corner of the custom cursor.  (To get the old cursor back, go to file/ build settings/ player setting/ default cursor, and select none)
